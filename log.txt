learned python basics
convertion of png color image to grayscale image
converting grayscale image to binarized image 

file : binarization.py
libraries : cv2, numpy, matplotlib

methods tried : global thresholding  - (fastest, with no noise)
				adaptive mean - 
				adaptive gaussian - (average performance - maybe suitable balance)
				otsu's method (2nd best resutl, time consuming)
				otsu's method with gaussian blur (best result, time consuming)
