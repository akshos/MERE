learned python basics
converting image to grayscale
converting rgb image to binarized image 

file : binarization.py
libraries : cv2, numpy, matplotlib

methods tried : global thresholding  - (fastest, with no noise)
				adaptive mean -  noisy and time consuming
				adaptive gaussian - noisy and time consuming
				otsu's method - best result
				otsu's method with gaussian blur - noisy for noisy input
