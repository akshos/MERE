learned python basics
converting image to grayscale
converting rgb image to binarized image 

file : binarization.py
libraries : cv2, numpy, matplotlib

methods tried : global thresholding  - (fastest, with no noise)
				adaptive mean -  noisy and time consuming
				adaptive gaussian - noisy and time consuming
				otsu's method - best result
				otsu's method with gaussian blur - noisy for noisy input

RESULT : use Otsu's method for binarization step

setup git accounts and repository
testing otsu's thresholding with noisy images, images with background lines and shadow
created binarize() function

file : binarize.py
libraries : cv2

Segmentation using contour detection in opencv.
Obtained bounding boxes with their x,y coordinates and their width and height.

Observation : Works well with plain paper as background 
	      Does not work with ruled paper as background
