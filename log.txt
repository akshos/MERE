learned python basics
converting image to grayscale
converting rgb image to binarized image 

file : binarization.py
libraries : cv2, numpy, matplotlib

methods tried : global thresholding  - (fastest, with no noise)
				adaptive mean -  noisy and time consuming
				adaptive gaussian - noisy and time consuming
				otsu's method - best result
				otsu's method with gaussian blur - noisy for noisy input

RESULT : use Otsu's method for binarization step

setup git accounts and repository
testing otsu's thresholding with noisy images, images with background lines and shadow
created binarize() function

Segmentation using contour detection in opencv.
Obtained bounding boxes with their x,y coordinates and their width and height.

Observation : Works well with plain paper as background 
	      Does not work with ruled paper as background
